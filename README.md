# UX

## I realized this project as part of the Data centric development module that I am completing at "code academy" training course.

### The App is built for a librarian or whoever is in charge to run,create or manipulate data for a library.

### I tried to make the app interface as simple and easy to navigate as possible,the homepage provides a nav-bar menu to explore the app's functionalities which I will look into more in deep further on,and a footer which provides social media links.

### The nav menu, footer, home-button and background image are repeated in all website pages to make the app having a consistent style.
